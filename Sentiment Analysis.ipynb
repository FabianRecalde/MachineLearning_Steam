Alot of down to earth \"zombie\" splattering fun for the whole family. Amazed this sort of FPS is so rare.\",\"It's unique and worth a playthrough.\",\"Great atmosphere. The gunplay can be a bit chunky at times but at the end of the day this game is definitely worth it and I hope they do a sequel...so buy the game so I get a sequel!\",\"I know what you think when you see this title \"Barbie Dreamhouse Party\" but do not be intimidated by it's title, this is easily one of my GOTYs. You don't get any of that cliche game mechanics that all the latest games have, this is simply good core gameplay. Yes, you can't 360 noscope your friends, but what you can do is show them up with your bad ♥♥♥ dance moves and put them to shame as you show them what true fashion and color combinations are.I know this game says for kids but, this is easily for any age range and any age will have a blast playing this.8/8\",\"For a simple (it's actually not all that simple but it can be!) truck driving Simulator, it is quite a fun and relaxing game. Playing on simple (or easy?) its just the basic WASD keys for driving but (if you want) the game can be much harder and realistic with having to manually change gears, much harder turning, etc. And reversing in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as I imagine it would be with an actual truck. Luckily, you don't have to reverse park it but you get extra points if you do cause it is bloody hard. But this is suprisingly a nice truck driving game and I had a bit of fun with it.\",...,\"a must have classic from steam definitely worth buying.\",\"this game is a perfect remake of the original half life. personally one of the best remakes i have played in a long time. there are a few changes in the remake but for the most part its almost the same as the original half life.the game still needs Xen to be completed but all the other chapters are ready for you to play and enjoy. i say buy this game if you loved the original half life. but avoid it if you can t wait for xen to be completed.\",\"had so much fun plaing this and collecting resources xD we won on my first try and killed final boss!\",\":D\",\"so much fun :D\"]]\n",
